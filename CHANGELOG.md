- ✅/⚠️ flags on exercises per source caution levels
- `docs/lateral-shift-sources-extracted.md` — full extraction from both notebooks committed to repo as permanent source intel

## v10 — 2026-03-14
- **Build 1:** `app_versions` table in Supabase — living source of truth for app state. Claude Chat can query current version anytime.
- **Build 2:** GitHub Action auto-logs version + commit SHA to Supabase on every push to main.
- **Build 3:** `APP_VERSION` constant in app JS; version badge rendered in bottom-right corner of UI.
- **Build 4:** "📤 Send to Claude Chat" button — generates formatted workout summary (exercises, weights, BPM, notes) and opens iOS/Android share sheet or copies to clipboard.
- **Build 5:** Post-save confirmation toast confirms workout is saved and ready for Claude Chat analysis.
- **Exercise Notes:** Per-exercise textarea auto-saves to Supabase `exercise_notes` table. "Last week you said…" callout surfaces prior session notes before you start each exercise. Pattern alert after 3+ consecutive weeks of notes on the same exercise.
- **BPM Screenshot Scan:** `analyze-bpm` Supabase edge function — pick Samsung Health screenshot from Photos directly in app, Claude extracts BPM/zones automatically. No more switching to Claude Chat.
- **Exercise Swap:** Swap button on every exercise card opens bottom sheet with S/A-tier alternatives grouped by equipment (Machine / Smith / Cable / Free Weight). Filters out exercises already in today's workout.
- **PR Isolation by Equipment:** PRs tracked per exercise-equipment combination — switching Machine→Smith→DB doesn't pollute your PR records.
- **Auto-Progression:** PR streak tracking (`prStreaks`). 🚀 Level Up badge after 3+ consecutive PR sessions on same exercise.
